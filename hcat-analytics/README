This project is for SAVI demo in July.


libraries should be copied to HBase/lib
hcat-analytics.jar
hschema-hd.jar
org.json.jar


Schema is very important because the data will be queried based on the schema
especially for spatial schema.

This schema works only in the engine, and there is no need to put it into HBase server side.
For the spatial data, we design the HGrid schema like this:
	"schema":{		
		"space": "-138.95,41.77,60,19",		
		"indexing":"2",
		"encoding":"1",
		"tile":"-1",
		"subspace":"0.01"
	},
0.01 is based on the density of the data points. keep each columns having around 1000 points.
